The app lets you set persistent pins on a map to remember where you left your car in the parking lot.

## Implementation:
I've used a MVVM architectural pattern. To make it more interesting and pleasant for the user, I've used a theme configuration for Google Maps to make it darker (dark gray and lime green).
